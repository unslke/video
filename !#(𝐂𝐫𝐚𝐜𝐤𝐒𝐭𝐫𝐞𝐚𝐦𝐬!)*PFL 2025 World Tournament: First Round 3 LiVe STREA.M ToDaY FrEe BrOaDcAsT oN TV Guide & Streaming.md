The fight card feature the opening round matchups in the lightweight and middleweight divisions and includes three former PFL tournament winners in competition,

Lightweight Alternate Bout: Robert Watley (15-3) vs. Antonio Caruso (10-2)

including Impa Kasanganay who faces former Bellator title challenger Fabian Edwards in the main event contest. Below, we look at how to watch or stream the 2025 PFL World Tournament 3 fight card.

The main event of the PFL World Tournament 3 fight card features 2023 light heavyweight tournament winner, and 2024 PFL 2105-pound tournament finalist, Impa Kasanganay vs. former Bellator title middleweight title challenger Fabian Edwards.

The PFL 3 main card looks pretty good on paper. Gadzhi Rabadanov is the lone egregiously priced favorite. Beyond him, you’re getting solid value no matter which way you bet.

Fabian Edwards stands out as a pretty compelling upset pick, while the last fight on the main card features a total toss-up between Jay Jay Wilson and Mads Burnell.

You can roll with my PFL 3 predictions when it comes to the main card, or read on for a little more analysis as to why I like each pick.
