On Friday Boxing are eagerly anticipating the upcoming showdown between two local Boxing powerhouses: Bakary Samake vs. Roarke Knapp These two teams, 

known for their competitive spirit and skilled players, have a longstanding rivalry that adds an extra level of excitement to this much-anticipated game.

 As fans prepare for this epic battle on the field, let’s take a closer look at the history and significance of this rivalry.

Junior middleweight Roarke Knapp had been moving along nicely until he hit a speedbump in the form of unheralded Mexican Jorge Garcia Perez last June and was stopped in three-rounds.

Knapp has since returned to the win column but when the opportunity came to go to Paris, France and face the unbeaten Bakary Samake on Friday, he knew it was too good to turn down.

"I need to get myself back to title contention," Knapp (17-2-1, 12 knockouts) told The Ring. "The fact I've got a shot at the WBC [Silver] title against Samake is a great opportunity to do that and one I know and believe I can win.

Next Friday, April 18, the boxers will face off in the ring at La Défense Arena, Nanterre, Hauts-de-Seine, France.

Samake won his title in November of last year by knocking out Wade Ryan in the seventh round. That card also took place in France, where Samake and Ryan headlined the event.

The Frenchman will enter this fight undefeated, boasting a record of 17 wins, including 9 by knockout.

Roarke Knapp, from Johannesburg, South Africa, held the ABU super welterweight title in June 2022. This will be his first opportunity to compete for a WBC-sanctioned title.

He comes into the bout with a record of 17-2-1 (12 KOs).

Both fighters passed the official weigh-in without problems and reported themselves ready for war.

"It can catapult me and my career into the right place and where it needs to be and kinda redeem myself from that loss and try to challenge for a world title in the near future."

The 26-year-old South African admits the loss derailed him but has since picked himself up and dusted himself and is ready to jump back into the deep end.

"I carried on like I normally would, it's not something I think about too often and lingers, every now and then, I do wonder where I would be, if I had won but I'm also a very firm believer in that things happen for a reason," he said. 

"In order to get better, you have to bump your head a few times and that's part of building experience, it's training wheels, it's obviously not the type of loses I want to take at world level but if that's how it has to be, then so be it, if that's what it means to grow and get better."
